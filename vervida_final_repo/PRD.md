## Features and Functional Requirements

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| As a user, I want to automatically sort my tasks by urgency, relevance, and personal goals, so my to-do list stays actionable. | Tasks are auto-sorted and tagged; user can override. |
| As a team lead, I want to assign and prioritize tasks across my group, getting real-time status updates. | Group tasks show ownership and status; notifications for overdue/blockers. |
| As a professional, I want an AI assistant that surfaces relevant knowledge, suggests next steps, and keeps meetings productive. | Chat agent analyzes context, extracts info, and makes actionable recs. |
| As a user, I want all my notes, tasks, and calendar events unified in one dashboard. | All three synced and viewable. |
| As a developer, I want GitHub issues triaged and routine repo actions automated. | GitHub integrated; automation of issue management. |
| As a team member, I want to collaborate on shared projects, so everyone can view and update relevant tasks. | Multiple users can access and edit tasks linked to a shared project. |

**Workflow:**  
- On task creation/modification, AI agent applies contextual sorting (short-term vs. long-term goals)  
- Real-time chat parses conversations + task stack to assist and automate  
- Tasks, notes, and events unified in a browser dashboard  
- Shared projects allow multi-user task collaboration

## Technical / AI Requirements

- Support multiple AI models (GPT-4.5, O3 mini, DeepSeek) for reasoning vs. speed tradeoffs  
- Continuous personalization via user context, preferences, and histories  
- Secure Supabase backend with RLS for data isolation  
- GDPR-compliant data handling  
- Browser-based, modular APIs for external tool integration (Slack, GitHub, Google Calendar)  
- Fast response target: 95% of operations <2 seconds  

---

## Success Metrics

- ≥75% user satisfaction (CSAT) after one month  
- ≥60% reduction in manual prioritization actions, measured via logged override/reorder events  
- ≥50% faster project completion in team settings  
- ≥90% average task completion rate for tasks assigned via VerVida
